## Xiaofeng Tan (谭晓锋)


I am a second-year M.Sc. student in the PALM Lab (led by Prof. Xin Geng) @ Southeast University (SEU) supervised by Prof. Hongsong Wang, currently exploring new frontiers as a Research Intern at Tencent’s YouTu Lab. Prior to that, I was a remote visiting student at LV LAB @ Singapore Management University (SMU), advised by Prof. Pan Zhou.

My academic journey began at Shenzhen University (SZU), where I built a strong interdisciplinary foundation by earning a dual bachelor’s degree. I graduated with an honors B.E. from the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) and a B.Sc. from the School of Mathematical Sciences (MS). It was there, under the mentorship of Prof. Can Gao, that I first delved into academic research.

My research interests mainly revolve around RLHF, RLVR, AIGC, and 3D Human Modeling. I am actively seeking (1) research internships at top-tier companies available after Mar. 2026, (2) Ph.D. positions for Fall 2027 (preferably in America, Singapore, or Hong Kong SAR), and (3) any research collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email (xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn) or WeChat (txf_06_20), and I’d be happy to connect 😊. And if you’d like to talk about Doraemon 😺, that works too.
