I am a second-year M.Sc. student in the [PALM Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) (led by Prof. [Xin Geng](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/xgeng/index.html)) @ [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) supervised by Prof. [Hongsong Wang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hongsongwang/main.htm), currently exploring new frontiers as a Research Intern at [Youtu Lab @ Tencent](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open). Prior to that, I was a remote visiting student at [LV Lab](https://www.lv-lab.org/SMU/index.html) @ Singapore Management University (SMU), advised by Prof. [Pan Zhou](https://panzhous.github.io/).

My academic journey began at [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), where I built a strong interdisciplinary foundation by earning a dual bachelor's degree. I graduated with a B.E. from the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering ([CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/)) and a B.Sc. from the School of Mathematical Sciences ([MS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/)). It was there, under the mentorship of Prof. [Can Gao](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=953), that I first delved into academic research.


My research interests mainly revolve around RLHF, RLVR, AIGC, and 3D Human Modeling. I am actively seeking (1) `research internships` at top-tier companies available after Mar. 2026, (2) `Ph.D. positions` for Fall 2027 (preferably in America, Singapore, or Hong Kong SAR), and (3) other `research collaborations`. Feel free to reach out via 📧 Email: `xiaofengtan@seu.edu.cn` or 💬 WeChat: `txf_06_20`. I’d be happy to connect 😊. And if you’d like to talk about *Doraemon* 😺, that works too.
